To set the time:
----------------

import busio
import adafruit_pcf8523
import time
import board
 
myI2C = busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)
rtc = adafruit_pcf8523.PCF8523(myI2C)
t = time.struct_time((2017,  10,   29,   15,  14,  15,    0,   -1,    -1))
# you must set year, mon, date, hour, min, sec and weekday
# yearday is not supported, isdst can be set but we don't do anything with it at this time
print("Setting time to:", t)     # uncomment for debugging
rtc.datetime = t


Test code:
----------
spi = busio.SPI(board.SCK, MOSI=board.MOSI, MISO=board.MISO)
cs = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D10)
sdcard = adafruit_sdcard.SDCard(spi, cs) # have to do this and following line when card is out
vfs = storage.VfsFat(sdcard)
storage.mount(vfs,'/sd')
storage.umount(vfs) # can try this to make sure it's gone before remount
with open('/sd/filename.txt','a') as f:
    f.write('hello\n')
can use if 'sd' in os.listdir('/') to see if it's mounted
